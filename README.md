## Getting Started

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

You can either clone this repository or download the ZIP file. If you're using Git, you can run:

```bash
git clone [Coffee Lovers](https://github.com/jharreldesign/coffee-lovers)
```

Alternatively, you can simply download the ZIP and extract it to a folder.

### 2. Open the Project

Navigate to the folder where you have the project. Inside this folder, you should see the following files:
- `index.html`
- `hotdrinks.html`
- `colddrinks.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`
- `hotdrinks.js`
- `colddrinks.js`

### 3. Open the `index.html` File

Open the `index.html` file in your favorite code editor. This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.

### 4. Edit the CSS and JavaScript

- **CSS**: Edit `styles.css` to modify the appearance of the webpage. Use CSS properties like `color`, `font-size`, `margin`, and more to style the elements defined in the HTML.
  
- **JavaScript**: Edit `script.js`, `hotdrinks.js`, `colddrinks.js` to add interactive behavior to the webpages. You can manipulate the DOM, handle events, and perform actions such as form submissions or API requests.

### 5. Open in a Browser

To see the webpage in action, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge). You can do this by double-clicking on the file or right-clicking and selecting "Open with" and choosing your browser.

## Running the Project Locally

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt.**
2. Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/project-folder
```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
